# Introduction

--

The following fun facts about LiDAR sensors are:

- LiDAR Detection Makes 'Uncrashable Cars' Possible.

- LiDAR is a key component in self-driving or autonomous cars <sup>1</sup>. Sensors are mounted to the front of cars, with projects lasers sending pulses of light to detect potential hazards including other vehicles, pedestrians and obstacles. 

--

- It’s Used By NASA to Profile the Entire Earth and LiDAR Can Rediscover Lost History.

--

- It’s A Key Component in Creating ‘Smart Cities’ <sup>2</sup> and Helps Emergency Responders Deliver Aid After Natural Disasters.

This helps autonomous vehicles “see” other road users like cars, pedestrians, and cyclists, all without the help of GPS or a network connection.

# Let us begin learning about LiDAR!

# What are LiDAR?

We need to understand more about the LiDAR:

- Lidar, which stands for **Light Detection and Ranging**, is a remote sensing method that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure ranges (variable distances) to the Earth.

- These light pulses—combined with other data recorded by the airborne system — generate **precise, three-dimensional information** about the shape of the Earth and its surface characteristics.

---

# Components and Use of LiDAR

The major hardware components of a lidar system include a collection vehicle (aircraft, helicopter, vehicle, and tripod), laser scanner system, GPS (Global Positioning System), and INS (inertial navigation system).

A lidar instrument principally consists of a laser, a scanner, and a specialized [GPS](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/geodesy/gps/) receiver. Airplanes and helicopters are the most commonly used platforms for acquiring lidar data over broad areas. LiDAR fall into the general categories of use:  

- LIDAR (sometimes also written as "LiDAR", "Lidar", or "LADAR") is used in a wide range of land management and planning efforts, including hazard assessment (including lava flows, landslides, tsunamis, and floods), forestry, agriculture, geologic mapping, and watershed and river surveys.

- In iPhones, starting in iOS 15.4, you can access the LiDAR camera on supported hardware, which offers high-precision depth data suitable for use cases like room scanning and measurement.

## Bathymetry LiDAR

- The term "bathymetry" originally referred to the ocean's depth relative to sea level, although it has come to mean “submarine topography,” or the depths and shapes of underwater terrain.

- In the same way that topographic maps represent the three-dimensional features (or relief) of overland terrain, bathymetric maps illustrate the land that lies underwater. Variations in sea-floor relief may be depicted by color and contour lines called depth contours or isobaths.,

- Bathymetry is the foundation of the science of hydrography<sup>*</sup>, which measures the physical features of a water body. Hydrography includes not only bathymetry, but also the shape and features of the shoreline; the characteristics of tides, currents, and waves; and the physical and chemical properties of the water itself.

.footnote[
[*] [Hydrography](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/hydrography.html) is the science that **measures and describes** the physical features of bodies of water.]

---

## Topographic LiDAR

- A pulsed laser is optically coupled to a beam director which scans the laser pulses over a swath of terrain, usually centred on, and co-linear with, the flight path of the aircraft in which the system is mounted, the scan direction being orthogonal to the flight path.

- The round trip travel times of the laser pulses from the aircraft to the ground are measured with a precise interval timer and the time intervals are converted into range measurements knowing the velocity of light.

- The position of the aircraft at the epoch of each measurement is determined by a phase difference kinematic GPS.

- Rotational positions of the beam director are combined with aircraft roll, pitch, and heading values determined with an inertial navigation system (INS), and with the range measurements, to obtain vectors from the aircraft to the ground points.

- When these vectors are added to the aircraft locations they yield accurate coordinates of points on the surface of the terrain.

# Analog vs Digital

Some differences between using analog (left) and using **digital** (right):

.pull-left[
1. When that analog voltage is fed into an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) it will be converted into a digital signal.

1. If this ADC is instead located somewhere outside the sensor (typically inside the system microcontroller or an ADC chip) then the sensor is analog.
]

.pull-right[
1. If this ADC is built into the sensor itself then that sensor is digital.

1. Digital sensors are usually preferable if their price and specifications are acceptable. This is because digital sensors are less susceptible to electrical interference and they have a lower design risk.

# CSS

Among all options in `xaringan::moon_reader`, the most challenging but perhaps also the most rewarding one is `css`, because it allows you to customize the appearance of your slides using any CSS rules or hacks you know.

You can see the default CSS file [here](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/blob/master/inst/rmarkdown/templates/xaringan/resources/default.css). You can completely replace it with your own CSS files, or define new rules to override the default. See the help page `?xaringan::moon_reader` for more information.

---

# CSS

For example, suppose you want to change the font for code from the default "Source Code Pro" to "Ubuntu Mono". You can create a CSS file named, say, `ubuntu-mono.css`:

```css
@import url(https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Ubuntu+Mono:400,700,400italic);

.remark-code, .remark-inline-code { font-family: 'Ubuntu Mono'; }
```

Then set the `css` option in the YAML metadata:

```yaml
output:
  xaringan::moon_reader:
    css: ["default", "ubuntu-mono.css"]
```

Here I assume `ubuntu-mono.css` is under the same directory as your Rmd.

See [yihui/xaringan#83](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/83) for an example of using the [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) font, which supports ligatures in program code.

---

# CSS (with Sass)

**xaringan** also supports Sass support via **rmarkdown**. Suppose you want to use the same color for different elements, e.g., first heading and bold text. You can create a `.scss` file, say `mytheme.scss`, using the [sass](https://sass-lang.com/) syntax with variables:

```scss
$mycolor: #ff0000; 
.remark-slide-content > h1 { color: $mycolor; }
.remark-slide-content strong { color: $mycolor; }
```

Then set the `css` option in the YAML metadata using this file placed under the same directory as your Rmd:

```yaml
output:
  xaringan::moon_reader:
    css: ["default", "mytheme.scss"]
```

This requires **rmarkdown** >= 2.8 and the [**sass**](https://rstudio.github.io/sass/) package. You can learn more about **rmarkdown** and **sass** support in [this blog post](https://blog.rstudio.com/2021/04/15/2021-spring-rmd-news/#sass-and-scss-support-for-html-based-output) and in [**sass** overview vignette](https://rstudio.github.io/sass/articles/sass.html).

# Themes

Don't want to learn CSS? Okay, you can use some user-contributed themes. A theme typically consists of two CSS files `foo.css` and `foo-fonts.css`, where `foo` is the theme name. Below are some existing themes:

```{r, R.options=list(width = 70)}
names(xaringan:::list_css())
```

---

# Themes

To use a theme, you can specify the `css` option as an array of CSS filenames (without the `.css` extensions), e.g.,

```yaml
output:
  xaringan::moon_reader:
    css: [default, metropolis, metropolis-fonts]
```

If you want to contribute a theme to **xaringan**, please read [this blog post](https://yihui.org/en/2017/10/xaringan-themes).

# Sharingan

The R package name **xaringan** was derived<sup>1</sup> from **Sharingan**, a dōjutsu in the Japanese anime _Naruto_ with two abilities:

- the "Eye of Insight"

- the "Eye of Hypnotism"

I think a presentation is basically a way to communicate insights to the audience, and a great presentation may even "hypnotize" the audience.<sup>2,3</sup>

.footnote[
[1] In Chinese, the pronounciation of _X_ is _Sh_ /ʃ/ (as in _shrimp_). Now you should have a better idea of how to pronounce my last name _Xie_.

[2] By comparison, bad presentations only put the audience to sleep.

[3] Personally I find that setting background images for slides is a killer feature of remark.js. It is an effective way to bring visual impact into your presentations.

# Naruto terminology

The **xaringan** package borrowed a few terms from Naruto, such as

- [Sharingan](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Sharingan) (写輪眼; the package name)

- The [moon reader](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Moon_Reader) (月読; an attractive R Markdown output format)

- [Chakra](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Chakra) (查克拉; the path to the remark.js library, which is the power to drive the presentation)

- [Nature transformation](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Nature_Transformation) (性質変化; transform the chakra by setting different options)

- The [infinite moon reader](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Infinite_Tsukuyomi) (無限月読; start a local web server to continuously serve your slides)

- The [summoning technique](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Summoning_Technique) (download remark.js from the web)

You can click the links to know more about them if you want. The jutsu "Moon Reader" may seem a little evil, but that does not mean your slides are evil.
